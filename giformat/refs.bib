	abstract = "Chapter 4 begins with a detailed explanation of the 5 fundamental traits of SDN we introduced in Chapter 3. We define the term Open SDN to mean an SDN network based on these 5 fundamental traits. We then provide a high-level overview of the operation of an SDN network based on these traits. While this overview is generic, it is motivated by the principles behind OpenFlow. This overview includes definition of the three main components of such an SDN network, their respective roles and how they interact with one another. These three components are the SDN controller, the SDN devices (switches) and SDN applications. Important OpenFlow terminology such as flow, flow entry and flow table are introduced. As SDN has gained momentum, some networking vendors have responded with alternate definitions of SDN, which better align with their own product offerings or are directly targeted at specific needs in the data center as opposed to more general networking problems. We group the most important of these alternate SDN implementations in two categories, SDN via existing APIs and SDN via hypervisor-based overlay networks, and discuss them separately in the latter half of this chapter."
